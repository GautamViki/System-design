Designing a low-level system for an elevator in Go (Golang) involves thinking about the core components such as the elevator itself, floors, passengers, requests, and the actions that an elevator can take (e.g., moving up or down, opening or closing doors). Here's a detailed approach for building such a system.

Elevator System Requirements
Floors: The elevator will operate between a defined number of floors.
Elevator Movement: The elevator can move up and down.
Requests: Users can request the elevator from different floors, both for going up and down.
Pickup Requests: The elevator needs to respond to pickup requests from outside (from different floors).
Drop Requests: Passengers can specify the floor they want to go to after boarding the elevator.
States: The elevator will have various states such as idle, moving up, moving down, and stopped.
Doors: The elevator needs to open/close doors.


Explanation of Key Components
Elevator struct: Manages the elevator's current state (floor, direction, etc.).
Request struct: Represents an elevator request from a passenger or an external call.
Move function: Moves the elevator towards its destination based on the current requests.
Controller: The brain behind the elevator system, responsible for processing the requests and directing the elevator’s movements.
Concurrency: go controller.ProcessRequests() starts a separate goroutine to handle the elevator’s state, ensuring it runs independently.

Future Enhancements
Multiple Elevators: You could extend this system to manage multiple elevators in a building by adding more Elevator instances and creating a more advanced controller to allocate requests between elevators.
Optimization: Introduce a scheduling algorithm for deciding which requests to prioritize (e.g., closest floor first).
User Interface: Provide an API or UI for users to call the elevator and input destination floors.
This Golang system provides a basic working structure for an elevator's core functionality, which can be extended and optimized depending on specific requirements.
